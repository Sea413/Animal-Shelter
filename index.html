      <h1>Peety The Dog</h1>
      <p>
        Peety is somewhat house broken and loves all the people. We do not know if he is sentient but he is well loved at the shelter. Please do not cast him in any live action movies!

    <div class="cat">
      <h1>Quagmire the cat</h1>
      <p>
        We do not know why this cat is here, but here is so we need an adoption, He tends to hunt the other animals so being alone is recommended. All adoptions are final.. for reals.
